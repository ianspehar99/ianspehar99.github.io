About Me
=====
***
I am currently pursuing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University, with a focus on robotics. I’m passionate about using robotic technology to solve real-world problems and create a positive impact, especially in renewable energy and environmental sustainability.

For my thesis I am working under Dr. Richard Wirz, focusing on the integration of robotics into cutting-edge additive manufacturing technology.

I have a broad set of engineering skills, but I mostly love developing software for robot intelligence, finding creative ways to automate and solve complex challenges. I’m currently looking for a robotics job after I complete my M.S. degree this June, where I can apply my skills, learn new things, and make meaningful contributions.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and resume for more about my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or have any questions!
