Overview: Pollock is a repurposed Kinova robot arm that autonomously analyzes images and translates them into artistic interpretations using brush strokes

Personal contributions: Developed the core algorithm that interprets images and converts them into a sequence of brush stroke commands for the robot to follow

Code Features: Processes images by identifying contours and condensing them into points. Implements advanced pathing logic to create sequenced brush strokes, producing a painting resembling the original image
